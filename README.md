Nowadays, cancer has become a very common thing that takes so many lives and sometimesitâ€™s not curable. But we can at least try to detect it by new technologies. Our medical field needs swift, machine driven, effective and reliable technique to detect cancer. After detection a patient can get proper treatment and with this detection doctor keeps a patient out of danger. In this paper, we explore machine learning and deep learning that can be applied to help increase the accuracy of the diagnosis of cancer. The main aim of this endeavour is to detect cancer with the help of various machine learning and deep learning techniques and develop a web application to interact with a user about their problems. We present a diagnosis model using machine learning and deep learning algorithms are used where a user signs up/signs in to our web page and give answers to some questions to analyse and detect if he/she has cancer or not. The performance of the model depends on accuracy, Precision, f-value of machine learning algorithmbased model which will help us to predict if the user has a high or low risk of cancer. The user can further feed MRI images into a second classification model which shows if the affected area is normal, benign or malignant. Malignant case patient can see the nearest clinics for the further diagnosis for the betterment.
